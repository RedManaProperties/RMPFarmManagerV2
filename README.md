# RMPFarmManagerV2
Version 2 of the Red Mana Properties Farm Manager

The new improved version of the Farm Manager provides a web interface, and the ability to import and export data.

A live version is available for free at https://rmpfarmmanagerv2.streamlit.app/

NOTE: You must import your database each session, and export when you're finished. Unsaved changes will not be retained.

All data is exported as a .csv file, including historical data.

This app is still experimental. NO WARRANTY.
